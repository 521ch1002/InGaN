sinter_homogeneous.in file is the input file to run the sintering simulation of homogenous sperical nanoparticles. This file works 30 - 25 nanoparticles pair only. 
To run the same input file for diffterent nanopartilces pairs, such as 30 - 30, 30 - 20, or 30 - 15, it is required to change the radius in the input script file.
also sintering temperature can be changed as requird by changing temperature in the NVT command line in the input script.
similarly, sinter_heterogeneous.in file is the input file to run the sintering simulation of heterogeneous sperical nanoparticles. This file works 30 - 15 nanoparticles pair only.
To run the same input file for diffterent heterogeneous nanopartilces pairs,  such as 30 - 30, 30 - 25, or 30 - 20, it is required to change the read_data filoe name in the input script file and each file name can be found here.
similarly, sintering temperature can be changed by changing temperature in the NVT command line in the input script.
